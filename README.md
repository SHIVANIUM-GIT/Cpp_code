# C++ STL Components Demo

This C++ program demonstrates the use of various Standard Template Library (STL) components. It provides a menu-driven interface to select and interact with different STL containers: vectors, stacks, queues, and maps.

## Code Explanation

- The code uses a `while` loop to create a menu for selecting STL components.
- Input validation is used to ensure the user enters a valid choice.
- Based on the choice, the code demonstrates the selected component.
- For "Vector," "Stack," and "Queue," the user can input elements into the respective container, and they can exit the input process by entering "0."
- For "Map," the user can input key-value pairs, and they can exit this process by typing "exit."
- The code displays the elements of the selected STL component.
- The menu continues to loop until the user selects the "Exit" option.
